}

// adopting naming conventions in Java makes it easier for others and yourself to understand
// packages: always lowercase, unique, use your internet domain name reversed ('com.nealtheseal108')
// replace invalid characters (ex: '-') in the domain name with an underscore; domain name components starting with a number should instead start with an underscore
// domain name components that are Java keywords should have that component start with an underscore
// class and interface names should use PascalCase, should be intuitive
// method names should be camelCase, verbs that reflect their function
// constants should be all uppercase, words should be separated by underscores
// field names should be camelCase, meaningful and indicative, should not utilize underscores
// type parameters should be single capital letters, E - element, T - type, K - key, V - value
